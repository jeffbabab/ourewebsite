        <h2>My Dearest Hana ðŸ’–</h2>
        <p>Valentineâ€™s Day is often celebrated on the 14th of February. Although this day is a time to show how much you love a person by spending money on gifts, it is also a day that some people donâ€™t wish to come. But for me, I feel it is worth it no matter how much I spend on you this Valentineâ€™s Day. And for me, I welcome the next Valentineâ€™s Day in 2026 and the many more Valentineâ€™s Days to come in the future.</p>
        <p>I would love to spend this beautiful day with you, but I am afraid that because of school, I cannot. I hope that someday we can spend it together and have a romantic dinner or just stay by each otherâ€™s side.</p>
        <p>Frankly speaking, you are the most special person in my life. Every moment with you is magical, and I cherish every smile, every laugh, and every memory we've made together.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being you. I know you have your flaws, and so do I, but I will always accept them and support you all the way.</p>
        <p>Will you always be my Valentine? ðŸ’–</p>
        <p>With love,<br>Jeric</p>
